# tcptohttp
This is a trimmed down version of a server in which I have implemented HTTP protocol from scratch following RFC 9110.
This project is a simplified implementation of an HTTP server that was created from the ground up in accordance with RFC 9110's requirements.
Without using any high-level frameworks or libraries, it illustrates the fundamental functions of the HTTP/1.1 protocol, such as request parsing, response formatting, header management, and connection handling.

Highlights:


constructed from the ground up with HTTP/1.1 semantics in mind.

carries out RFC 9110's request/response parsing.

manually manages connection persistence, status codes, and headers.

Simple and instructive, with an exclusive focus on the foundations of protocol.
